## Overview

GameEngine is a from-scratch game engine with custom rendering, audio, input, and physics subsystems. It demonstrates low-level system design, efficient memory management, and multithreaded architecture â€” optimized for both 2D and 3D use cases.

This project showcases expertise in:

- Systems programming (C++, multithreading, memory layout)
- Graphics programming (OpenGL/Vulkan)
- Clean architecture and modular design
- Developer experience (tooling, scripting, debugging)

---

## Features

- **Custom ECS** with archetype-based memory layout
- **Real-time Renderer** (OpenGL 4.5 with support for deferred and forward rendering)
- **Cross-platform** via GLFW and SDL2
- **Custom Input Abstraction Layer**
- **Audio Engine** with 3D sound and effects (OpenAL)
- **Physics System** (with optional Box2D/PhysX integration)
- **Lua/Python Scripting Bridge**
- **Hot Reloading**, live asset streaming
- **Scene Serialization** using JSON/Protobuf
- **Integrated Debug Tools**, UI console, performance profiling
